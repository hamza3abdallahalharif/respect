<img src="hh.jpg">
<b><p>Self-respect means valuing yourself and treating yourself with kindness and dignity. It’s about knowing that you deserve good things and not letting others treat you poorly. Here’s a simple breakdown of what self-respect involves:

    Recognize Your Worth: Believe in your own value, no matter what others think.
    <br>
    Set Boundaries: Know what is acceptable for you and don’t be afraid to say "no" when something doesn’t feel right.
    <br>
    Take Care of Yourself: Look after your physical and mental health by getting enough rest, eating well, and doing things that make you feel good.
<br>
    Be True to Yourself: Don’t try to please others at the expense of your own values or beliefs.
<br>
    Own Your Mistakes: Accept responsibility when you make mistakes and learn from them, instead of being hard on yourself.
<br>
    Speak Up: Be assertive about your needs and feelings without being aggressive or passive.
<br>
    Surround Yourself with Positive People: Spend time with those who respect and support you.</p></b>
