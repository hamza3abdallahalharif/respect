<h1>Respect People</h1>
<b><p>Respecting people's information means recognizing the importance of their privacy and treating their personal details with care and consideration. Here are some simple ways to show respect for others' information:
<br>
Keep it confidential: If someone shares personal information with you, don't share it with others without their consent.
<br>

Ask before sharing: If you're unsure whether you can share someone else's info, always ask them first.
<br>

Be mindful of context: Understand that personal details may be shared for specific purposes, and respect that context when handling the information.
<br>

Don't pry: Respect people's boundaries and avoid asking for information that feels too personal or intrusive.
<br>

Secure sensitive information: If you're handling sensitive data (like passwords, financial info, or medical details), make sure it's stored or shared securely.
<br>

Respect their choices: If someone decides not to share certain information, respect their decision without pressuring them.</p></b>
